JOIN 
-INNER JOIN
-LEFT JOIN
-RIGHT JOIN 
-CROSS JOIN

1)INNER JOIN
- The INNER JOIN selects records that have matching values in both tables
//syntax

SELECT columns FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name(FOREIGN KEY)= table2.column_name(PRIMARY KEY)

EG:
SELECT * FROM user INNER JOIN city ON user.city = city.cid
or 
SELECT * FROM user  JOIN city ON u.city = c.cid
or 
SELECT u.id,u.name,u.age,u.gender,c.cityname FROM user u JOIN city c ON u.city = c.cid WHERE c.cityname="Pokhara" ORDER BY name;
//here city is foreign key in user table and cid is primary key on city table

2) LEFT JOIN 
-the LEFT JOIN  returns all records from the left table(table1), and the matched records from the right table(table2)
//syntax 
SELECT columns FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_1=table2.columnn_name;
eg:-
SELECT * FROM user u LEFT JOIN city c ON u.city=c.cid;

3) RIGHT JOIN 
-the RIGHT JOIN returns all records from the right table(table2), and the matched records fro the left table(table1)
SELECT p.id,p.name,p.ade,p.city FROM user u  RIGHT JOIN city ON p.city=c.id;

4)CROSS JOIN
-the CROSS JOIN use to make combination of two tables
SELECTT * FROM  user CROSS JOIN city;
